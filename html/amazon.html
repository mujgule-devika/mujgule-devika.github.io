        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>
          Many large businesses are reacting to events in Ukraine finding ways
          to promote accurate information, and support the people of Ukraine.
          Amazon doesn’t have a robust feature set that does this, so let’s
          explore, and design a solution. Furthermore, let’s design this
          solution (or set of solutions) in such a way that it can be
          repuroposed for future humanitarian crisises, or major social issues.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Approach to Design Solution: Design Sprint</h1>
        <p>
          We approached the problem as a Team of 4 and structured the Design
          Sprint and worked as a group to answer few of the following questions
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the questions we’ll need to answer in this sprint?</li>
          <li>Discussion: who do we think will use this product?</li>
          <li>
            Discussion: imagine the perfect outcome for this project, what would
            it do for customers, for businesses, for Amazon?
          </li>
          <li>
            How might we: Anything that sounds difficult, or feels like an
            opportunity capture as a how might we.
          </li>
          <li>Rapid competitve research</li>
          <li>Explore the Amazon UI</li>
          <li>
            Discussion: imagine this project was a total failure - what could go
            wrong? Why would customers hate it, why would Amazon remove this
            feature?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Initial Sketches & Dot Voting</h1>
        <p>
          After the Sprint and answering the questions we short listed a set of
          features and made initial hand sketches.
        </p>
        <h1>A few set of features that we brainstromed were:</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>A different screen for Ukraine (or any social cause)</li>
          <li>
            Entry points: Support Ukraine Tab, Dedicated Card on home screen
          </li>
          <li>
            Educational Material: Prime Video recommendations, Amazon Music,
            Podcasts
          </li>
          <li>Hashtag feature to highlight products and in a search bar</li>
          <li>Donations at Checkout</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Hand Sketches</h1>
        <p>
          Hand Sketches are a very powerful tool - we leveraged this even more
          to explore solutions - explore more screens in more detail. The main
          objective was to create designs quickly at a low cost and in much
          greater detail. We skipped wireframing in this project and heavliy
          leveraged Hand Sketches. This was easy, quick and low-effort. It
          helped my brainstrom multiple design solutions for a solution in mind.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>High Fidelity Prototypes</h1>
        <p>
          The design aims at clear and intuitive feature set. A roboust amount
          of features to support the cause. It deliveres multiple features and
          ways to aid a social cause. These set of features are designed in a
          manner that they can be repurposed and reused for different social
          causes.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h1>Feature set and Prototype</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Dedicated entry menu point, card and new page for the cause</li>

        <div>
          <h1>Ways to Repurpose and Reuse Features</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Can be replace with different causes. A new dedicated screen is
              added which can be repurposed
            </li>
            <li>
              Educational Material: This will source information regarding
              furure cause
            </li>
            <li>
              Can be used again to show support by sellers or source different
              products e.g sustainable products, etc along with hashtage feature
            </li>
            <li>

        <div>
          <h2>Test Preparation</h2>
          <p>
            For usability testing, I conducted interviews with 6 people. I
            explained the motive and goal of the app. Prepared list of questions
            to ask the used before and after running the usability tests and
            prepared a set of tasks for them to carry out.

            <h2>Running Usability Tests</h2>
            <p>
              The users were asked to share what they were doing, thinking, and
              feeling while interacting with the prototype and trying to
              complete the tasks given to them. I tested around the key tasks I
              identified earlier in the process, asking the user to browse the
              overall app, select distracting apps, go to stats page, set
              notification message, set timer for app and blacklist some apps.
