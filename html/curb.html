          A smartphone has become a neccesity but recently, people are not just
          dependent but addicted to phone. Especially social media. After
          analysis, everyone showed a need to control their social media usage
          and have more control on blocking specific apps

              With the screen time manager app I want to learn if users think
              it’s important to manage and track their screen time for wellbeing
              and what apps they’re using for it. I am trying to understand what
              kind of goals users want to achieve from the app. Like better
              productivity, overcome obsession with particular apps or phone,
              restrict usage, etc.. I want to understand how effective the apps
              have been in helping them reduce their screen time. I would like
              to know what works and doesn’t work in the app they use.

            To synthesize all the information I had gathered from the user
            interviews, I wrote my findings on sticky notes and created an
            empathy map. By identifying common patterns across my findings, I
            was able to uncover key insights which helped me understand who
            users are and what they truly need.

              Some apps could be distracting. Students need a better way to

            Using my understanding of the user, our goals, and the user’s
            interaction with the app they already use, I worked on how to design
            Curb’s screens by first hand sketching. This was easy, quick and
            low-effort. It helped my brainstorm multiple design solutions for a
            solution in mind

          <p>
            After finalizing the best options from hand sketches I worked on
            making wireframes. Before working on the visual design, I wanted to
            first make sure that the design was functional. In order to do this,
            I decided to create a mid-fidelity prototype which would help me
            quickly test the design and make any revisions before integrating
            the branding and visual design. I created mid-fidelity wireframes on
            Figma of the key screens the users would be interacting with.

            The design aims at simple navigation and higher flexibility to set
            app timers and screen time goals. It delivers easy to understand
            stats and higher control on granularity of them

              I customized a palette using the coolors tool. Initially I used a
              set of warm colors but changed to more calmer colors for a zen
              feeling.

              For usability testing, I conducted interviews with 6 people. I
              explained the motive and goal of the app. Prepared list of
              questions to ask the used before and after running the usability
              tests and prepared a set of tasks for them to carry out.

                The users were asked to share what they were doing, thinking,
                and feeling while interacting with the prototype and trying to
                complete the tasks given to them. I tested around the key tasks
                I identified earlier in the process, asking the user to browse
                the overall app, select distracting apps, go to stats page, set
                notification message, set timer for app and blacklist some apps.
